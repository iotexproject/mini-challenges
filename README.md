# Code challenges for our community's devs (*#IoDevs*)

## Intro 🏁
Do you have 5 to 10 minutes of spare time, and still feel like tickling your developer brains?  

Every week the *IoTeXperts* team is going to post a new issue with a mini code challenge for the developers in our community. 

**Winners will be announced every Tuesday on our [IoTeX Developers Twitter account](https://twitter.com/iotex_dev)**. 🎉🎉🎉

## HIW 🤔
Each challenge is created as an **issue** in this repository. 

There are two ways of submitting your answers: 

1. Comment your solution on the issue, and post a link in the comments of the corresponding Tweet that will come out from the [@iotex_dev](https://twitter.com/iotex_dev) account every Tuesday.
2. Comment your solution directly on the Tweet

**Happy Hacking** 🤖
