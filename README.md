# Small code challenges for the #IoDevs

## Intro
Do you have 5 to 10 minutes of spare time, and still feel like tickling your developer brains? Every week the *IoTeXperts* team is going to post a new issue with a mini code challenge for the developers in our community. 

**Winners will be announced every Tuesday on our [IoTeX Developers Twitter account](https://twitter.com/iotex_dev)**. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## HIW
Each challenge is created as an *issue* in this repository. 

There are two ways of submitting your answers: 

1. Comment on the issue, and post a link in the comments of the corresponding Tweet that will come out from the @iotex_dev account every Tuesday.
2. Comment directly on the Tweet

Happy Hacking ðŸ¤–
